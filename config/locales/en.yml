# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      text: 'Starting at Harvard in 2011, the Library Test Kitchen is a seminar and community bringing together librarians, students, and designers to discover innovative new programs, services, and spatial strategies for libraries. Participants created wifi-proof booths, study carrels for napping, and digital campfires for charging devices convivially. Over its life, the seminar created a pop-up library lab in a retail storefront space in Harvard Square, visited SXSW, and moved from Harvard to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at Simmons College. Now, it''s forking again, into a cookbook in parts: first, this platform for sharing "recipes" for playful, participatory innovation in libraries; and second, a book, to be published by MIT Press. And you can contribute! Feel free to browse the recipes collected hereâ€”and to use them, share them, adapt them, and share back, by contributing recipes of your own!'
