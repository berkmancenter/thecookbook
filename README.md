- "Fork" a recipe you want to change
- Upload a photo of the cooked recipe

## Developers

I'm always happy to recive pull requests, but right now don't have a fully
fleshed out contributor guide. If your familar with rails setup you should get
far. You'll need to create a `.env` file with a few configuration options to get
everything up and running.

I will update this section as soon as I have a bit more downtime :heart:

To get started:

    $ bundle install
      [edit .env]
    $ rake db:setup
    $ rails c
